          Most visits are focused on single-day projects and punch lists: repairing damaged drywall, updating
          fixtures, assembling furniture, or tackling the small jobs that have been sitting on your to-do list.
          Each project is scoped so you know what will be completed and what to expect on the day of service.

          Whether you are preparing for guests, handling a move-in or move-out, or finally fixing recurring

          on time, protecting floors and surfaces, and cleaning up thoroughly before leaving.

          Carlsbad Fix It serves homeowners, small landlords, and local businesses across coastal and nearby
