Fixture swaps are one of the fastest ways to refresh a kitchen or bathroom in Oceanside. The key is selecting updates that fit existing shutoffs and grouping them in the same area of the home.

## What fits in one visit

A focused visit can typically handle:

- One kitchen faucet swap
- One to two bathroom faucet swaps
- Toilet internal parts or a single toilet replacement
- Shower head replacement

For service details, see the [plumbing fixtures page](/services/plumbing-fixtures-repairs/) and local coverage in [Oceanside](/service-areas/oceanside/).
