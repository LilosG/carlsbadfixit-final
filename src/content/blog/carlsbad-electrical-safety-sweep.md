Small electrical issues can make a Carlsbad home feel frustrating day to day. This safety sweep helps you spot quick fixes that usually fit a single visit and improve comfort without a full electrical upgrade.

## 10 quick fixes to prioritize

1. Replace loose or cracked switch plates.
2. Tighten outlets that wiggle in the wall.
3. Swap flickering bulbs and mismatched color temperatures.
4. Install dimmers in living areas for better light control.
5. Balance ceiling fans so they run quietly.
6. Replace outdated bathroom vanity lights.
7. Fix a single outlet that stopped working.
8. Replace old smoke alarm batteries.
9. Secure loose light fixture canopies.
10. Swap an outdated dining fixture for a clean, modern look.
