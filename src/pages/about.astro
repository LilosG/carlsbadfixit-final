            Built around practical, repeatable visits
          </h2>
          <p class="text-body-sm text-cf-textMuted">
            Carlsbad Fix It grew out of repeat requests from homeowners who needed help with
            projects that were too small for a general contractor but too involved for a
            quick DIY fix. The focus is on work that can be planned carefully, completed
            cleanly, and repeated reliably from home to home.
          </p>
          <p class="text-body-sm text-cf-textMuted">
            Most visits combine several tasks—like drywall touch-ups, fixture swaps, and
            small carpentry repairs—so more progress is made each time we are in your home.
