    question: "What kinds of projects are a good fit for Carlsbad Fix It",

    question: "Which areas do you serve",

  {
    question: "How does pricing work",
    answer:
      "Pricing depends on the number of tasks, how involved each one is, and how many areas of the home are included. Smaller jobs may be billed as a minimum service visit, while larger or multi-room projects are usually quoted up front."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide free estimates",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can request a no-obligation estimate by sharing your location, a short list of tasks, and any helpful photos. You will receive clear next steps and timing before anything is scheduled."

      "Many projects use a mix of materials supplied by the homeowner and standard items supplied on the truck. Details on what is included will be explained as part of your estimate so you know what to expect."
