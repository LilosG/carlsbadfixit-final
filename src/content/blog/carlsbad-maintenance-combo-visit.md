If your Carlsbad home needs several small updates, you can often combine a honey-do list with a handful of electrical or plumbing fixes in a single, well-planned visit. The key is keeping the scope tight and grouping tasks by room.

## Step 1: Choose one main room plus one secondary area

Example combinations:

- Living room + primary bath
- Kitchen + hallway
- Entry + guest bath

## Step 2: Pick 6 to 10 honey-do tasks

Examples that fit well:

- Tighten loose hinges and handles
- Patch small drywall dings
- Adjust sticky doors
- Replace worn caulk at baseboards

See the [honey-do list service page](/services/honey-do-lists-small-repairs/) for a full scope overview.

## Step 3: Add 1 to 2 fixture swaps

Choose one electrical or plumbing update:

- Swap a dining fixture or install a dimmer ([electrical service](/services/electrical/))
- Replace a kitchen or bathroom faucet ([plumbing fixture service](/services/plumbing-fixtures-repairs/))

## Step 4: Confirm local availability

Check the [Carlsbad service area page](/service-areas/carlsbad/) and review the [Carlsbad electrical](/service-areas/carlsbad/electrical/) or [Carlsbad plumbing](/service-areas/carlsbad/plumbing-fixtures-repairs/) pages if your list leans that direction.
