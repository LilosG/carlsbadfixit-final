const faqVisit = [
  {
    question: "What kinds of projects are a good fit for a handyman visit?",
    answer:
      "Visits are best for small to medium home projects that can be completed with light carpentry, drywall repair, fixture swaps, basic electrical, and similar work. Larger projects can sometimes be broken into clear phases that fit within several visits.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer free estimates?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can share a punch list, photos, and your location for a no-obligation estimate. In most cases, we are able to provide a ballpark range and visit plan remotely before anything is scheduled.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I combine several different types of work into one visit?",
    answer:
      "Often yes. When tasks are in the same general area of the home, combining them into a single visit is usually the most efficient option. During scheduling, we will clarify what is realistic for the time available.",
  },
];

const faqScheduling = [
  {
    question: "Which areas do you serve?",
    answer:
      "Carlsbad Fix It is based in Carlsbad, CA and focuses on nearby North County communities such as Oceanside, Encinitas, Vista, and San Marcos. Availability in each area depends on scheduling and overall project scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I schedule?",
    answer:
      "Scheduling often depends on the time of year and current workload. For most small projects, reaching out 1–2 weeks before you would like the work completed provides the most flexibility in picking a visit window.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if my project takes longer than expected?",
    answer:
      "If it becomes clear that a project will exceed the planned visit, we will pause, explain what remains, and outline options. When possible, the most important items are completed first so progress is still made even if more time is needed later.",
  },
];

const faqPricing = [
  {
    question: "How does pricing work?",
    answer:
      "Pricing depends on scope, access, and timing. Smaller projects are usually more cost effective when combined into a single visit, while larger or more complex projects may be scheduled as half-day or full-day blocks.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you charge for travel?",
    answer:
      "Travel time is factored into how visits are scheduled so more of your appointment can go toward actual repair and improvement work. If additional travel is required beyond the regular service area, that will be discussed before you decide to move forward.",
  },
  {
    question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
    answer:
      "Payment is typically collected at the end of the visit. Common options include major credit cards and digital payments. Any details specific to your visit will be confirmed along with the estimate.",
  },
