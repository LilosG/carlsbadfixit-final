Lighting and small electrical issues can make an Encinitas home feel dated during showings. The good news is that many of the most visible improvements fit into a single, focused visit. Use this checklist to prioritize the updates that make your home feel bright, clean, and ready for buyers.

## Top electrical fixes that show well

- Replace mismatched or outdated light fixtures
- Upgrade dimmers in living and dining areas
- Swap burned or flickering bulbs
- Replace loose or discolored switch plates
- Install a quiet, balanced ceiling fan in the primary bedroom

If you want professional help, review the [electrical service page](/services/electrical/) or confirm coverage in [Encinitas](/service-areas/encinitas/).

## What fits a single visit?

Most pre-listing electrical work fits when you:

- Focus on one main floor plus the primary bedroom
- Group fixture swaps in the same area
- Keep troubleshooting to one or two items

For a local breakdown, see the [Encinitas electrical page](/service-areas/encinitas/electrical/).

## Prep steps to keep the visit efficient

1. Choose fixtures that match the existing boxes.
2. Confirm bulb type and warmth for consistency.
3. Clear access to ladders and shutoffs.

## Optional add-ons to consider

Pair electrical updates with a short [honey-do list visit](/services/honey-do-lists-small-repairs/) for patching wall dings and tightening hardware in the same rooms.

## Ready to schedule?

Use the [contact page](/contact/) to share your timeline and fixture list. A clear plan ensures the work fits before listing photos and showings.
